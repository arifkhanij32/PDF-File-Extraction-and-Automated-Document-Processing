# PDF Extraction App

This is a full-stack PDF extraction application built using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Features
- Role-based access control for Admin and Super Admin.
- PDF upload and text extraction.
- Dynamic viewing of extracted text.
- CRUD operations for template keys.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, PyPDF2
- **Frontend**: React.js, Material-UI, Axios
- **Auth**: JWT

## Installation

### Backend
1. `cd backend`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure environment variables in `.env`.
4. Run the app: `python app.py`.

### Frontend
1. `cd frontend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `npm start`.

## API Endpoints
- `POST /auth/signup`
- `POST /auth/login`
- `GET /templates/`
- `POST /files/upload`

How to Use It: If someone else wants to replicate the environment using this requirements.txt file, they need to install each dependency using:

bash
Copy code
npm install $(cat requirements.txt)
Or, they can install them one by one manually using npm install.

Recommended Method: A package.json file is the standard in React projects for managing dependencies. You can recreate it by running:

bash
Copy code
npm init
npm install <dependencies>


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
